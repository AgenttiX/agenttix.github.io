# Radio frequencies and devices
This guide is a work in progress.

Please note that nothing on this site is financial or legal advice.
You are responsible that the devices you purchase and the ways you use them
are compatible with the local laws and regulations, e.g. for radio frequencies.


## Frequency bands
- [PMR446](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMR446): UHF CB, 446 MHz
  - Does not require a license in Finland, nor in the most EU countries.
    - Maximum transmit power: 500 mW
    - Antenna: fixed, non-removable, must not have a connector for an external antenna
  - Analogue PMR446
    - 16 FM channels separated by 12.5 kHz
  - [dPMR446](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_private_mobile_radio) (Digital PMR446)
    - DMR Tier I
      - [TDMA (Time-division multiple access)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-division_multiple_access)
      - 16 digital voice channels separated by 12.5 kHz, 4-level FSK modulation, 3.6 kbit/s
    - [FDMA (Frequency-division multiple access)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-division_multiple_access)
      - 32 digital voice channels separated by 6.25 kHz, 4-level FSK modulation, 3.6 kbit/s
- [RHA68](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/RHA68): VHF, 67.500 â€“ 72.325 MHz
  - Finnish national standard
  - Does not require a license in Finland since 2017.
  - 5 - 25 W depending on the frequency
    - The 25 W frequencies are not allowed to be used within 10 km of the national borders.
- [CB (Citizen Band)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_band_radio): 27 MHz

Frequency bands in other countries:
- [FRS (Family Radio Service)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Radio_Service)
- [GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Mobile_Radio_Service)
- [MURS (Multi-Use Radio Service)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-Use_Radio_Service)


## Squelching
Squelching enables the use of the same frequency band by multiple users without disturbing each other,
as long as they don't transmit at the same time.
The radio only outputs the audio when the received signal contains the correct squelch code.
This is not actual privacy nor encryption, even though it's often marketed as such.
- [CTCSS (Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Tone-Coded_Squelch_System)
- [DCS (Digital-Coded Squelch)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squelch#DCS)


## Walkie-talkies
Here are some suggestions for walkie-talkies.
- PMR446
  - The easiest choice, especially if you travel in Europe outside of Finland
    - Fixed antenna, maximum transmit power 500 mW, must not have a connector for an external antenna
    - Should support all the 16 channels with at least analogue PMR446 (FM)
    - Should support CTCSS and DCS squelching
    - Preferably should support also dPMR446 if this does not increase the price too much


### Useful features
- Headphone connector
- USB-c charging
- Water resistance
- Flashlight
- Belt clip
