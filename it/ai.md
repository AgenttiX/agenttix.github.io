# Artificial intelligence (AI)

## Online AI tools
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)
- [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com)
- [DeepSeek](https://chat.deepseek.com/)
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)
- [STORM](https://storm.genie.stanford.edu/)
  - For creating scientific summaries

## Security
AI tools are vulnerable to the data they are given.
E.g. [Microsoft Copilot can follow instructions hidden in an incoming email](https://disobey.fi/2025/profile/disobey2025-331-living-off-microsoft-copilot),
if given access to your email inbox.
This can result in exfiltration of sensitive data.
