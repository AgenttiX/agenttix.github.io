# Receiving help
If I have given you the link to this page,
it means that I want to help you.
However, to save our time, I would hope that you could do a few preliminary things first.
Please follow the instructions below depending on the type of the device you need help with.


## Windows computer
- If the device has a battery, connect it a power supply and charge it to at least 80 %
- Install the latest Windows Updates
  - Instructions are available
    [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-the-latest-windows-update-7d20e88c-0568-483a-37bc-c3885390d212)
  - Please reboot the computer after the updates if it asks you to do so.
- Install and run my maintenance script
  - If you already have the "Maintenance" shortcut on your desktop, please click it.
    If you don't, please follow the instructions to install it [here](https://github.com/AgenttiX/windows-scripts/blob/master/README.md).
    The installation can be somewhat complicated, but please at least try.
- If I have asked you to run the reporting script,
  please click the "Create IT report" shortcut on your desktop.
  This shortcut is created by running the maintenance script.
- If I have asked you to install TeamViewer,
  please install it using my installer script that gets installed along with the maintenance script.
  If you have issues in installing using the installer script, you can download TeamViewer

## Network issues
First run [Speedtest](https://www.speedtest.net/) and take a screeshot of the results, or save the link to the results.
Also run [IPv6 test](https://ipv6-test.com/) and take a screenshot of the results.
Then try the following steps and check after each step if the issue persists.
- If you have a VPN enabled, try disabling it, if the service you're trying to access does not require the VPN.
- Restart your router (and modem if they are separate devices).
  - Unplug the power cord (or turn the power switch, if any), wait for 10 seconds, and turn the device back on.
- Try using another network connection, e.g. using your phone as a hotspot, and see if the issue persists.
- Update the firmware of your router.
  - Instructions are available on the manufacturer's website.
  - If your router is provided by your internet service provider (ISP), see their website for instructions.
