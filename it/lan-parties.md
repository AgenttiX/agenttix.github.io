    which leads to connectivity issues with wireless devices.

    - The power outlets may be limited, so you should be able to power all your devices from a single socket.

    - If your laptop does not have an Ethernet port, bring a USB to Ethernet adapter as well.
      If you have a USB-c or Thunderbolt dock for your laptop and it has an Ethernet port, you can use that as well.

  - Including the power supply and the necessary cables
