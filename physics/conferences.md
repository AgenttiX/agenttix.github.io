# My tips for attending scientific conferences
- Fully prepare all your slides before the conference
  - When at the conference, you want to focus on networking and learning instead of preparing the slides
- Practice your talk before the conference
  - Ensure that it fits the given time limit
- Talk to people! :)
  - Networking is a lot about getting to know people in general so that you can later contact them more easily.
    You don't necessarily have to discuss work.
    What matters is that they remember you. (And hopefully in a positive way. :D)
