# Politics
If you live in a democracy, vote!
"If you choose not to vote, you're not in a position to complain about the result of the vote."

One can also have an effect by citizen initiatives on multiple levels.
- Finnish municipalities: [Kuntalaisaloite](https://www.kuntalaisaloite.fi/)
- Finnish legislation: [Kansalaisaloite](https://www.kansalaisaloite.fi/)
- EU: [European citizens initiative](https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/)
