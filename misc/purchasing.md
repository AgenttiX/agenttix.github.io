- Acrylic can be quite rough on the skin compared to wool.
  This is why I personally prefer to avoid acrylic.
- Bamboo is viscose where the cellulose is originally from bamboo trees.
- Cotton is a good basic material.
- Fleece is bad for the environment,
  since it produces lots of microplastics.

- Polyester also sheds microplastics, but not as much as fleece.
  Personally I avoid polyester except on sports clothes and clothes where I need water resistance.
- Viscose, aka. rayon, is made from cellulose.
