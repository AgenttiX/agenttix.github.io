# TV shows

## [Mr. Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot)
The depth and accuracy of technical details is astonishing.
This is how hacking and information technology in general should be portrayed in TV shows.


## [Star Trek: The Next Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)
This is my favourite TV show from my childhood and teenage years.


## [Star Trek: Picard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Picard)
All three seasons discuss deep themes
about the human condition and human connection.
What does it mean to be a human?
Could we somehow be better than human?
Could we connect to and love each other in a deeper way than Homo sapiens is capable of?
These themes resonate deeply with the underlying motivations of
[transhumanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism).

To quote a Borg Queen: *"Imagine, being loved, completely,
every thought and whisper cherished, shared. With our minds joined as one, we could be more. I am the only
one in the entire universe that has ever truly seen you."*
(S2:E5, 26:15->)

And a scientist: *"What if we take this ship and build a better Borg? A real collective based
not on assimilation but salvation. Think about it: a Borg collective that embraces the uniqueness of its
members.*"
(S2:E9, 32:45->)

Here's a
[video overview of the Borg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVnAsamgzjE).
However, it contains heavy spoilers for Star Trek: Picard starting from 23:45->.


## [The Queen's Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen%27s_Gambit_(miniseries))
