# Books
Here are some of the books that I have read and can recommend for you to read as well.
THIS PAGE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.
I also wish I'd have more time for reading.

## Novels / fiction

### [Alice in Quantumland](https://www.amazon.com/Alice-Quantumland-Allegory-Quantum-Physics/dp/0387914951)
Alice in Quantumland is a parody of the classic Alice in Wonderland,
which by the way is written by the mathematician
[Lewis Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll).

### [Foundation series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series)
This is a classic of science fiction
and demonstrates the reader that valuing science and knowledge is essential for the success of a civilization.

### Harry Potter

### Ilkka Remes
Many of the characters are combinations of several people who have actually existed.

### [The Last Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Question)
There's also a great [comic version](https://imgur.com/gallery/9KWrH).

### [The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings)
An absolute masterpiece of imagination.

### Release that Witch
This is definitely among my favourite novels.
A chinese engineer gets reborn in a medieval kingdom as its prince
that has been banished to lead a small remote village,
where there's a witch hunt ongoing.
Therefore it's a classic
[isekai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai),
and the the first chapters suffer from some anime and manga cliches.
However, once the story gets going,
it's a tour de force of almost 1500 chapters
of the industrial revolution and the development of modern civilization,
and the amount of details is astonishing. To give you an example from chapter 33:
"Gunpowder was known as the secret weapon for mass production.
Its ingredients were easily accessible.
The prescription required three ingredients: sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter.
Gunpowder would be made by just mixing these three ingredients at at 1:1.5:7.5 ratio.
It could be easily produced without any technical barriers."
The importance of mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering,
economy and diplomacy for a modern society is not understated.
From there on the story slowly snowballs to the point that
[the Kardashev scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale)
and
[Clarke's three laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws)
become useful.
However, the book was unfortunately probably subject to Chinese censorship,
as the civilization in the book started to become too democratic for the Chinese government,
and this is visible in some abrupt turns of the plot.

[The manhua](https://manhuamanhwa.com/manga/release-that-witch/)
is not even nearly as good as the novel, but it has a few pages that give
[good glimpses](https://2nd.manhuamanhwa.com/manga_51e6d6e679953c6311757004d8cbbba9/chapter_6/chap_6_2.jpg)
into the story.
The novel also has
[a wiki](https://releasethatwitch.fandom.com/wiki/Release_that_Witch_Wiki),
but it contains very heavy spoilers and should not therefore be read before fully reading the book.
The only exception is
[the map of the Four Kingdoms](https://releasethatwitch.fandom.com/wiki/Map),
which is highly useful in keeping track of the various locations.
Unfortunately the writer had to cut the story short,
and the final chapters are quite hastily written.
As a fun coincidence, some ideas in the final chapters are close to the subject of my second master's thesis.

### [The Silmarillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion)
The "Bible of [Middle-earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth)".
It also contains fascinating use of historical language.


### [The Chronicles of Narnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia)
I've only read the books 0-3.


## Other

### [Anthropic Cosmological Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle#The_Anthropic_Cosmological_Principle)
This is definitely among my favourite books.
As reviewed by the journal Nature, it's
"practically a universal education in both the history of modern science and the history of the Universe."
The simplest version of the
[anthropic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle),
the weak anthropic principle,
states that an observer cannot make an observation that contradicts the existence of the observer.

To fully grasp the book, one should have a master's degree in theoretical physics,
plus knowledge of philosophy and history comparable to at least a bachelor's degree.
Some ideas in the book are also quite far-fetched and should be taken with a grain of salt.

Reviews:
[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/16/books/i-think-therefore-the-universe-is.html)


### [The Art of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War)
Despite being over 2000 years old, the stratagems of this book still apply in modern conflicts.

### The Bible
The Bible has been highly influential in shaping the development of western culture,
and even various [recent works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j2Q8yXx7vY) are largely based on its stories.
Just don't try to read it in the chronological order,
as you'd get bored to death when reading the genealogies,
and you'd also miss a lot of context.
It's better to start from the New Testament.
You'll find that it's
[quite different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40KcrrfbJ6o)
than the child-safe stories you may have heard.

### [Consciousness: The Science of Subjectivity](https://www.amazon.com/Consciousness-Science-Subjectivity-Antti-Revonsuo-ebook-dp-B00332KM3W/dp/B00332KM3W/)
Written by
[Antti Revonsuo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antti_Revonsuo),
a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the
[university of Sk√∂vde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sk%C3%B6vde)
in Sweden and of psychology at the
[university of Turku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Turku)
in Finland.

### [Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future](https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-Billionaire-SpaceX-Shaping-ebook/dp/B00SIDCSWY/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)

### Esko Valtaoja

### [The Fabric of Reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabric_of_Reality)
Written by
[David Deutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch),
a pioneer of quantum computing.

### [Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Deus:_A_Brief_History_of_Tomorrow)
Sequel to Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind.

### [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People)

### [No Place to Hide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Place_to_Hide_(Greenwald_book))

### [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind)

### [The Phenomenon of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phenomenon_of_Man)
This highly abstract, esoteric and difficult-to-read work includes a few ideas that were a lot ahead of their time.
The book was written in the 1930s, but foreshadows what we today call as the Internet,
and what transhumanists call as the
[technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity).

### [The Singularity is Near](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near)
Written by
[Ray Kurzweil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil)

For a less-handwavy version, please see Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies.

### [Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies)
The dangers of superintelligence are far greater than those of climate change or even a full-scale nuclear war.
However, its potential is equally great.
This book is written by
[Nick Bostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom),
the founding director of the
[Future of Humanity Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_Humanity_Institute)
at the University of Oxford.
