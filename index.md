# Mika's website
Welcome to my website!

Here are some tutorials and reviews that I have written,
many of them originally for personal use.
However, I thought that I could share them in the hope that they could be useful.

This is a personal website.
The opinions expressed here are my own,
and do not represent those of my employers or any other organization or person.

If you notice something that's wrong or missing,
please feel free to send me a message or create a pull request
[on GitHub](https://github.com/AgenttiX/agenttix.github.io).
