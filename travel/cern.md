# CERN Travel Guide

## Access to the CERN site
You should have received your visitor pass by email before arriving at CERN.
Using the code from the email, you can print your visitor pass at the phone booth near
[building 55](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bsRYcyB7D5kcvpfc8).
The visitor pass may only work for the gate near that building,
as the other gates may require a badge with a chip.


## Public transport
- [tpg+ app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.tpg.boldor)
- [SwissPass](https://www.swisspass.ch/)
- CERN also has rental bikes and e-scooters available on-site.
  (However, please check whether they are available for your visit type.)


## Internet access
There is Eduroam pretty much everywhere on-site.
However, you should preferably set it up at your home institution before arriving at CERN
and ensure that the Wi-Fi certificates etc. are configured properly.
When you first connect to the Eduroam network,
you'll have to accept the CERN terms and conditions before you can access internet.

### SIMs
If your phone supports eSIM, you can get it online before the trip.
If not, you can purchase the SIM card at the airport or in Geneva.
You may need to show your passport, though.

## Food
There are several canteens/restaurants on-site, but no grocery store.
Buy your groceries before arriving at CERN, as the snacks at the canteens are quite expensive.
Also note that most stores, including grocery stores, have short opening hours and are closed on Sundays.
